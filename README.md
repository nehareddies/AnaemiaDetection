# Anaemia_Detection

## HOW IT LOOKS?✨ https://youtube.com/shorts/hpwsPCPGzLQ?feature=share
[![HOW IT WORKS?✨](https://img.youtube.com/vi/hpwsPCPGzLQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpwsPCPGzLQ)
This Project would take in 5 inputs which are Gender, Hemoglobin, MCH, MCHC, and MCV and predict if you have Anaemia or not.

Gender: 0 - male, 1 - female

Hemoglobin: Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen to your body's organs and tissues and transports carbon dioxide from your organs and tissues back to your lungs

MCH: MCH is short for "mean corpuscular hemoglobin." It's the average amount in each of your red blood cells of a protein called hemoglobin, which carries oxygen around your body.

MCHC: MCHC stands for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. It's a measure of the average concentration of hemoglobin inside a single red blood cell.

MCV: MCV stands for mean corpuscular volume. An MCV blood test measures the average size of your red blood cells.
